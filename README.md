This is something I created because I am an avid reader and always found myself calculating how long it would take me to finish books that I read. I also wanted to make something using React.

This Single Page App allows users to figure out approximately how many pages per day they have to read per day in order to finish a book over a period of time. This can be a period of days, weeks, or months or a period between specific dates. This app uses Create-React-App and google-book-search, a node wrapper for the Google Books API.

Right now, users are encouraged to take a screenshot of their estimated pages per day needed. I plan to add the ability to save records to the app in the future.
